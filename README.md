# Desktop-Notifier
Desktop Notifier Using GUI Interface

We are creating a project that’ll generate a notification on the desktop in the interval of every 20 minutes.
The notifications will display useful text messages like news regarding COVID-19, meanings of rare English words to improve vocabulary of the user, Unknown health tips, positive quotes, “Take a short break” message , etc to refresh the user.
This project uses various python libraries like Request(request), Date and Time(datetime), Toast Maker (win20toast), Plyer and others.
We need to use API to fetch current updates and keep the user notified with latest news.
